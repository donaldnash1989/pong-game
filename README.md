# Pong

My implementation of the legendary Atari game that helped to launch the video game industry;
I've attempted to keep it as retro as possible with a few subtle additions for modern day gaming.

## Features Added:

* volume control
* Simple AI
* Difficulty Setting

## Running

The 'dist' folder has everything need to play the game.
Just copy the build folder and run the .exe file

## Development

* [Unity 2017.3.0f3 (64-bit)](https://unity3d.com/)
* [TextMesh Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126)
